## Summary
The minimum degree algorithm is one of the most widely-used heuristics for reducing the cost of solving large sparse systems of linear equations. It has been studied for nearly half a century and has a rich history of bridging techniques from data structures, graph algorithms, and scientific computing. In this repository, we provide an implementation of a simple but novel combinatorial algorithm for computing an exact minimum degree elimination ordering in $O(nm)$ time, which improves on the best known time complexity of $O(n^3)$ and offers practical improvements for sparse systems with small values of $m$.
